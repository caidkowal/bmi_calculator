# bmi_calculator

This Python project models and compares Old BMI and New BMI calculations using human body measurements.
It loads data from a .dat file, calculates both traditional and new BMI values, performs linear regression to find relationships (like Age vs BMI and Weight vs New BMI), and visualizes them using Matplotlib.


Features:

    Reads body measurement data from a file (body.dat)

Calculates:

    Traditional BMI (weight / height²)

    “New BMI” based on additional body measurements

    Performs linear regression to find trends between:

    Age vs. BMI

    Weight vs. New BMI

Computes and displays:

    Slope

    Intercept

    Correlation coefficient

Visualizes both models using Matplotlib
